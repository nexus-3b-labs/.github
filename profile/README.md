# Nexus 3B Labs ⚛️

**Democratizing Intelligence on Consumer Hardware.**

Welcome to **Nexus 3B Labs**, an open collective dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with **Small Language Models (SLMs)**. We believe that powerful AI shouldn't require a data center—it should run efficiently on the laptop in front of you.

## 🎯 Our Mission

To build accessible, privacy-first, and highly capable AI tooling that empowers developers to **Run**, **Train**, and **Reason** with local models completely offline.

## 🔭 Core Focus

We specialize in the **3B-7B parameter** sweet spot—models small enough to run on personal devices but smart enough to do real work.

*   **Local-First Architecture**: No API keys, no cloud dependency, no data leaks.
*   **Apple Silicon Optimization**: Deep integration with Metal (MPS) for MacBook users.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop**: Tools that help humans steer and understand AI, not just consume output.

## 🚀 Flagship Projects

### [NexusAI](https://github.com/nexus-3b-labs/NexusAI)
The ultimate research station for local AI.
*   **Chat**: A polished interface for interacting with local models.
*   **Train**: One-click **LoRA Fine-Tuning** to build custom personas.
*   **Reason**: Visual "Thinking Process" engine to debugging chain-of-thought.

> **⚠️ Compatibility Note**
> Currently, our tools are **Battle-Tested on Mac (Apple Silicon)**.
> Support for Windows and Linux is currently experimental and under active development.

## 🤝 Join the Lab

We are looking for contributors who love:
*   Python & Rust
*   React & Modern UI
*   Model Optimization (Quantization/Pruning)

*Let's build the local AI future together.*
